    <h4>Submit a Job</h4>
    <p>Work for America connects governments with talented technologists looking for the next step in their career.</p>
    <p><strong>Not your average job board</strong></p>
    <p>We'd like to help you hone the content of your job posting to make it attractive to top tech talent. Your Work for America posting can and should be different than a by-the-book job description. Follow the instructions and fill out the fields to the right, then give us the link to the original job post.</p>
    <p><strong>Ongoing feedback</strong></p>
    <p>Your job posting will go live immediately after you submit it, but we'll reach out in the coming days to help craft your message to increase interest in the post and clicks through to the original job link.</p>
    <p>Questions? Please contact us at <a href="mailto:work@codeforamerica.org">work@codeforamerica.org<a>.</p>
